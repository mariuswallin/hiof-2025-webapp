# Info

This is the database schema for the application. It defines the structure of the data stored in the database, including the tables, fields, and relationships between them. Also includes types that are more specific to the application's domain.

These could be organized in a feature folder structure for better organization, such as `features/questions/schemas` or `features/answers/schemas`.
